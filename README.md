## 🌐 Features

- 🌍 **Search by City Name**: Users can enter a city name to retrieve current weather and air quality for that location
- 📍 **Geolocation Support**: Fetch weather and pollution details based on the user's location using the browser's geolocation
- 🔄 **Fallback to GeoApify**: Uses GeoApify's geocoding service for latitude and longitude if the city name is not found on OpenWeatherMap
- 🌞 **Weather Details**: Get real-time data on temperature, weather conditions, humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times
- 🌫️ **Air Pollution Data**: Stay informed about air quality with pollution level indicators (such as PM2.5, PM10, and AQI)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application
- **CSS**: Basic styling
- **JavaScript**: Logic to fetch and display data
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For retrieving weather and air pollution data based on city name or geographic coordinates
- **GeoApify API**: Used as a fallback to fetch latitude and longitude if the city isn't found in OpenWeatherMap

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **API Keys**:
   - [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api): For weather and air quality data
   - [GeoApify API](https://www.geoapify.com/): For geocoding services

### Installation Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAJIV81205/Weather-Blast.git
   cd Weather-Blast
   ```

2. **Add your API keys to the script.js file**:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'your_openweathermap_api_key'; // OpenWeatherMap API key
   const geoAPI = 'your_geoapify_api_key'; // GeoApify API key
   ```

3. **Open index.html in your browser** to run the application locally

## 🔧 Key JavaScript Functions

- **getWeatherByCity()**: Fetches weather and air pollution data for a given city
- **getWeatherByLocation()**: Gets the user's geolocation for weather and air quality data
- **fetchLatLon()**: Fetches coordinates from GeoApify if the city isn't found
- **fetchWeatherByCoordinates()**: Fetches weather data using latitude and longitude
- **fetchAirQuality()**: Retrieves air quality data based on geographic coordinates
- **displayWeather()**: Displays weather information
- **displayAirQuality()**: Shows air pollution details like AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 levels

## 🧰 Error Handling

- **GeoApify Fallback**: If OpenWeatherMap does not recognize the city name, GeoApify fetches latitude and longitude
- **Geolocation Access Denied**: Notifies users if location access is restricted
